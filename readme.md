This project was an assignment for File Organization which aimed to show different implementations of coalesced hashing and performance differences between them. Program receives an input for number of elements to use for algorithms and produces either formatted table views for different algorithms. Shows comparisons between them for number of collisions, average number of probes required for retrieving a key etc. Contains a search functionality.

There were few requirements which were hard coded. Maximum number of elements are 900, packing factor is ~90%.

Inheritance and polymorphism used wherever possible. Algorithm extension can be easily done by extending any provided class or base class of CollisionResolver.
